<p>
<b>GNU EDMA</b> is the <i>Entorno de Desarrollo Modular y Abierto</i>,
or in English the
<i>Modular and Open Development Environment</i> (named MODE by <i>Russel
Reed</i> in the first GNU/EDMA documentation translations). The name is
in Spanish because <b>GNU EDMA</b> has been developed by GPI (Grupo de
Procesado de Imagen or Image Processing Group) at Vigo University,
Spain.
<p><b>GNU EDMA</b> provides an Object Oriented Component-Based
development
environment to build modular and evolving applications as well as
highly reusable components. To achieve this, <b>GNU EDMA</b> shares
features of OO programming languages and component based systems in a
loosely coupled environment.

<h3>GNU EDMA License Update Note</h3>

Like many other GNU systems, we are planning to update the EDMA license to
the new LGPLv3. Since LGPLv3 is not compatible with GPLv2-only applications 
and as EDMA is mainly a library, this update will not allow theses types of 
programs to continue using EDMA.
<p>
Before updating the EDMA license, we would like to know if any users of the 
system are using EDMA with a GPLv2-only application, because after changing
the EDMA licence, they won't be able to use EDMA any longer.
<p>
All applications using a GPLv2-or-later license will not be affected.
<p>
Please, let us know (<a href="mailto:info-edma AT gnu.org">info-edma AT
gnu.org</a>)if anyone is in this situation, so that we can look into
it.

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>January 2007</b>:: <b>CVS Release Beta 0.15.7 Rev 12</b>.
The main changes are listed below:
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Misc</b>.<br>
      Fixed compilation problems with gcc-4<br/>
      More Bug Fixes and Code cleanup<br>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
Old news can be found <a href="old_news.html">here</a>.

<h3>GNU EDMA's main features</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>OO Component-based Environment</b>:
    <p> Seamlessly mixes component-based and Object Oriented
programming models. Components can be managed as classes (the same way
that in any OO programming languages), or on an interface basis, as
other component systems do. </p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Dynamic OO features</b>:
    <p> All common OO features (inheritance, virtual method
override,...) that you can find in any programming language can be done
dynamically. Object's inheritance hierarchy can be changed dynamically
making it easier to build dynamically reconfigurable and evolvable
applications. </p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Classes or Objects</b>:
    <p> You can choose between your preferred OO flavor for developing
your application. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <i>Destructive Subclassing</i> as in C++ or Java where
superclass behaviors can be completely rewritten by subclasses </li>
      <li> <i>Conservative Subclassing</i> as in Beta/gBeta where
superclass behaviors can be only extended. </li>
      <li> <i>Prototype-Based</i> as in Self where parents are shared
classes and object prototypes are cloned. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Loosely-Coupled Architecture</b>:
    <p> GNU/EDMA OOP features are implemented on a loosely-coupled
basis which provides a clear separation between the analysis/design and
implementation stages.</p>
    <p> This approach allows the implementation of OO models even using
non-OO programming languages and to use features not supported by the
underlying environment (e.g. you can use multiple implementation
inheritance in Java when working with GNU/EDMA components). </p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Reflection</b>:
    <p> Full reflection API. Dynamically extract any information about
your classes and objects.</p>
    <p> The reflection API along with the string-based object access
interface makes <i>Object Automation</i> and the development of <i>Visual</i>
tools trivial. </p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Fully Extendable</b>:
    <p> Developed in C. Built-in sub-systems to extend internal
functionalities. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <i>SIU Subsystem</i> allows to change the default behavior
of the GNU/EDMA primitives. Its main target is integration of external
systems. </li>
      <li> <i>IngrIDF Subsystem</i> allows custom interface definition
language parsers. </li>
      <li> <i>EMI Subsystem</i> allows handling of exceptional
situations in the system. At the moment it only can be used to build
custom component/class loaders. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
<!--
  <li> <b>Portable</b>:
    <p> Highly portable system. Target system just needs shared memory
and libraries support. </p>
  </li>
-->
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Open Tasks and Help Wanted</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Beta Testing</b>:
    <p>Deep testing of the system on different environments is required ... </p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Foundation Classes</b>:
    <p> Basic class hierarchy to deal with common tasks. OS interface,
data structs,... </p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Programming Language Support and Scripting</b>:
    <p> Classes to allow development of GNU/EDMA components and
applications using other languages than C.<br>
Main target is <i>Guile</i>. <i>Perl (in progress)</i>, <i>Python
(in progress)</i>, <i>Ruby</i> and <i>Java</i> are other desired
targets. </p>
    <p> These classes will also allow to access GNU/EDMA core from
those programming language as well as use them as scripting language on
any GNU/EDMA application. </p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>System Integration</b>:
    <p> One of the most important objectives of GNU/EDMA is to provide
a common reuse framework, so integration of other technologies is one
of the pursued targets. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> CORBA integration. Requires a DII/DSI aware ORB in order to
exploit GNU/EDMA dynamic features </li>
      <li> Component Models. It would be interesting to make GNU/EDMA
work with current available component models (XPCOM, Bonobo, Qt
Component Model, UNO,...) so they can be easily reused in a common
fashion. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>GNU Project</b>:
    <p> Integration with other GNU projects. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>GNUStep</li>
      <li>GNOME. Including Bonobo and ORBit</li>
      <li>Guile as scripting language for GNU/EDMA applications</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Documentation</b>:
    <p> Project documentation requires review by native english
speakers. </p>
