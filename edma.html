EDMA is the Entorno de Desarrollo Modular y Abierto, or in English the
Open and Modular Development Environment. The name is in Spanish because
EDMA has been developed by GPI (Grupo de Procesado de Imagen or Image Processing
Group) at Vigos University, Spain.

<P>EDMA's main features are listed below:

<P><B>Component Architecture</B>

<P>EDMA is a system similar to the Component Object Model (developed by
Microsoft) or the System Object Model (created by IBM). This kind of system
offers a component framework for developing applications, where the application
is chopped into small pieces that are then combined. The difference between
Componentware and classical modular programming is that such pieces of
code are executable. This means that you can change parts of the applications
without recompiling all the code. Componentware is a bit like a dynamically
linked library; in fact a simple form for components is this kind of library.

<P><B>Object Oriented</B>

<P>As well as allowing developers to build their applications using components,
EDMA offers object oriented facilities over this componetware framework.
The programmer doesn't need to work with object orientation: EDMA applications
can be written in C, with EDMA as an easy way to use dynamically linked
libraries. But if the programmer wants to use the object-oriented facilities
in EDMA, they will obtain a higher level of reuse.

<P>In EDMA, classes are components and components are classes. That is,
you can build a component, a library, with some code and treat it as a
class, or you can build classes for your object model and store it in components
that you can update late, without recompiling the entire application. The
main difference between EDMA and other object-oriented systems is that
EDMA makes all the operations dynamically, at run-time. In the object-oriented
world, this means that you can make the most related operations such as
multiple inheritance and virtual method override while your application
is running.

<P>All the classes, components, or code fragments (whatever you call them)
installed in a system can be used by any application running in this system,
improving code reusability. So, you can take any class registered in your
system and use it as a base class for deriving new classes, without requiring
the source code of the first one. For example, if you have installed a
<TT>calendar</TT> class you can derive a new class from it, <TT>graphical_calendar</TT>,
that uses the main code of the calendar class for calculations and adds
code for graphical visualization. EDMA supports multiple inheritance, so,
if you have installed another class <TT>widget</TT>, you can make a new
class <TT>calendar_widget</TT> that inherits from <TT>calendar</TT> and
<TT>widget</TT>. This is the kind of reuse that EDMA achieves.

<P><B>Extension Systems</B>

<P>EDMA provides a set of extension systems included to make the use of
other technologies easy. EDMA wasn't developed as a substitution for any
other system; EDMA was developed for making the most of such systems.

<P>EDMA's extension systems allow one to use other systems from the same
framework and in the same way. So, these extension systems allow developing
wrappers for systems like Java, Guile, CORBA, or even ActiveX (the up side
of COM). The main goal of the extension systems is to improve application
development in the sense: "If there is some code that does that already,
why don't we use it?"

<P>Integrating other systems in EDMA can be difficult and depends on facilities
to interface to them, as with any tool that tries to use other ones. We
have developed a partial extension for using Java bytecodes from EDMA,
and some simple Guile code to use EDMA functions from Scheme. Guile and
CORBA integration are the main goals in this area.

<P><B>Download</B>

<P>The latest version of EDMA is 0.3r1 you can download it from <A HREF="http://wgpi.tsc.uvigo.es/~dyc/EDMASite">http://wgpi.tsc.uvigo.es/~dyc/EDMASite</A>.
We are working in the 0.4 version that will improve the dynamic inheritance
facilities of the system, as well as in the Guile and CORBA integration.
See Open Task for more information on this.
