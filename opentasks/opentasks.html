Open Tasks for EDMA</H2>
There is still a lot of work to do on EDMA. The system needs a lot of testing
in order to correct bugs and extend facilities. We now list some of the
tasks to be done. If you are interested in collaboration you can contact
us at <A HREF="mailto:dmartin@tsc.uvigo.es">dmartin@tsc.uvigo.es</A>.

<P><B>Main System</B>

<P>This section covers tasks in the main EDMA system. This is being worked
on mainly by David Mart&iacute;nez Oliveira, who wrote it.
<UL>
<LI>
<B>On-demand Interface Load</B>: The current version loads all the interfaces
when the system starts up. Future versions will load interface information
only when objects are created.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Error Management</B>: This includes Multilanguage error message support
and the full specification of the EMI subsystem.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Dynamic Object-Orientation</B>: This includes a more suitable interface
for managing dynamical inheritance relationships, and SIU subsystem integration
with the object-oriented facilities (SIU PROXIES of level 3). The final
task in this area will be the specification of what we call Loosely Coupled
Object Oriented Systems (LCOOS).</LI>

<LI>
<B>Dynamic Invocation Interface</B> to allow some languages to use EDMA</LI>

<LI>
<B>New primitives</B> such as <TT>clone</TT>, <TT>shallow_clone</TT>,...</LI>
</UL>
This modifications will form EDMA version 0.4.

<P><B>Porting</B>

<P>EDMA works on GNU/Linux systems as well as Windows 95 systems. We would
like to port it to systems such as OS/2 and other Unix flavors. Any help
towards this will be welcome.

<P>Sergio Costas is working on porting EDMA to OS/2

<P><B>Interpreted Systems</B>

<P>There are three main projects here:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>GUILIAN</B>: This project's goal is to create an interface to the GNU
Guile extension language. This would allow Guile applications to use EDMA
facilities and EDMA applications to use classes written in Guile.</LI>

<LI>
<B>JANE</B>: The same as GUILIAN but for the Java language. There is a
simple and still incomplete version for Windows 95.</LI>

<LI>
<B>EVELIN</B>: This will be a C-like interpreted language with special
constructors to use EDMA. The project includes an interpreter, a byte-code
compiler and a virtual machine.</LI>
</UL>
<B>SIU Extensions</B>

<P>Some tasks are oriented towards develop SIU PROXIES for using other
technologies.

<P>Interpreted systems fall in this section too.
<UL>
<LI>
<B>FAYE</B>: EDMA remote object facilities. This system requires full pack/unpack
code as well as bi-directional implementation, that is, you can use a remote
object from your local system, but this remote object can't see local objects.</LI>

<LI>
<B>SHARON</B> and <B>PENNY</B>: This system will provided shared object
and persistent object facilities for EDMA. There is no current development
on this.</LI>

<LI>
<B>CONNIE</B>: This SIU extension will integrate CORBA with EDMA, allowing
you to use CORBA objects from an EDMA application or EDMA objects from
a CORBA application. There is no current development on this.</LI>
</UL>
<B>EDMA Classes</B>

<P>This covers the development of EDMA classes for programmers' use.
<UL>
<LI>
<B>PORTABLE/1</B>: This will be a set of low level classes which provide
a portable interface to machines and operating systems, so as to make EDMA
source code portable.</LI>

<LI>
<B>IRINA</B>: This will be a set of classes for Graphical User Interface
development. The goal is to develop a powerful widget set that is fully
customizable, that is, to bring EDMA dynamic facilities to GUIs.</LI>
</UL>
